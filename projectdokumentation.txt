This APP is a DND like Assist tool there to support the GM and the Players. It follows a custom ruleset.
The grounding principles for the project is that everything should be easy and convinient todo. 
Like creating a new character for example is opening the server with a new url like characters/coolguy
This creates a real time synced page that everyone can edit and look at for that specific character.

[IMPORTANT]
The most important principle for the Project. EVERYTHING should be synced in real time and STATE should always be saved.
This applies for the sheet view and world view.
This is mostly done through json patches.
